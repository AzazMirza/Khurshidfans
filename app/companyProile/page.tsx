        <strong className="text-foreground">S.G.S Electrical Company</strong> was established in <strong>1990</strong> by visionary entrepreneur <strong>Mian Khurshid Ahmed</strong> with a singular mission: to manufacture <em>high-quality fans</em> for the people of Pakistan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under this vision, the <strong>“Khurshid Fans”</strong> brand was born — and soon revolutionized the industry by introducing Pakistan’s <strong>first locally produced BLDC ceiling and pedestal fans</strong>. This breakthrough slashed energy consumption from <strong>115 watts to just 55 watts per hour</strong>, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and sustainability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even before BLDC technology, Khurshshid Fans had earned its reputation as a <strong>premium brand</strong> — known for <span className="italic">transparency, quality craftsmanship, and customer trust</span>. The company relentlessly modernized its production: using <strong>99.99% pure copper</strong>, high-grade electrical steel, replacing lathes with <strong>CNC machining</strong>, and implementing <strong>conveyor-based assembly lines</strong> — raising the bar for the entire sector.

          “This forward-looking vision didn’t just transform our factory — it transformed an entire industry.”
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In recognition of its innovation and leadership, Khurshid Fans was honored with the prestigious <strong>“Best Fan Company of the Year 2024”</strong> award by the <strong>Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI)</strong>.
